doctorWhoGame
=============

This is a doctor who themed pygame based program. Most of the rules are explained by the program itself. There are currently only two map setups. These include detonating objects, falling crates, gates that open and close, teleporters, daleks, weeping angels, silence and members of their order, and cybermen.
