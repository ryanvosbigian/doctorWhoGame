Here is the program. Use the supplied images or use your own graphics for some of them(You probably dont have a graphic for a hanging crate) Im going to try to add weeping angels soon, and a third, more dangerous type of dalek. Anyway, you can actually test out the program if you alter the image paths. I would have transferred a nice folder full of all this but gmail only does files.
